In addition, the lifetime of most open source system stays for long periods of time. In this work, we comprehensively examine the evolution of bug reports in four different open source systems from various languages. The selected project are analyzed since 2004 in order to find how many bugs are reported compared to their resolution. We report our results and some recommendations to the open source community.
