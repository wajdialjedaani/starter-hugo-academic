abstract: Mobile app developers want to maximize their revenue and hence want to reach as large an audience as possible. In order to do this, they need to build apps for multiple platforms - like Google's Android and Apple's iOS, and maintain them in parallel. Past research has examined properties of the issues addressed in either Android or iOS, but not to compare the work between both. Our main motivation has been to determine if there were differences in how issues manifest themselves in iOS and Android, when we control for the projects, by considering the same apps across multiple platforms. In this paper, we compare issues across two mobile platforms - iOS and Android - for two open source browsers - Mozilla Firefox and Google Chromium.
