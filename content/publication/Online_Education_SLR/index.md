abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) comprises various sub-fields, including machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) perform a key role in the transformation of many industries, including education. It changes traditional learning methods by using its Innovative techniques and applications. Using its applications, the teachers may keep track of each studentâ€™s development, paying close attention to the areas in which they struggle. Many researchers are working with ML and DL to exploit its discoveries and insights. In education, traditional education methods (TEM) are the same for each student, which means each student is taught in the same way as ML and DL, making this process flexible and creative for solving complex problems and enhancing productivity. Nowadays, each institution adopts E-learning methods as the primary way of learning, especially during the pandemic.
