summary: An overview course in software engineering emphasizing software design and software development projects. The course will focus on object-oriented (OO) analysis, design principles, and techniques. Students will be introduced to OO modeling, design patterns, and design/code refactoring techniques. While there is a significant emphasis on product development, students will be required to use a rigorous process in a team-based product development project. Major topics include analysis and specification of software, subsystem modeling using patterns, and software testing. A term-long, team-based project is used to reinforce concepts presented in class. Programming is required. (Prerequisite(s) CSCE 3110 with a grade of C or better).
