abstract: The development of COVID-19 vaccines has been a great relief in many countries that have been affected by the pandemic. As a result, many governments have made significant efforts to purchase and administer vaccines to their populations. However, accommodating such vaccines is typically confronted with people’s reluctance and fear. Like any other important event, COVID-19 vaccines have attracted people’s discussions on social media and impacted their opinions about vaccination.
